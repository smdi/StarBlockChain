# Scalable Tensor Advanced Reinforcement(STAR) BlockChain

## Hey thereðŸ‘‹, I have designed this new concept of blockchain, that can scale in both vertical and horizontal directions, It believes in grouping related nodes or transactions together

### Features

```
Open Source
Proof of Stake(POS)
Grouping: It groups similar nodes or transactions together
Permanent: All transactions are premanent
Immutable: Data cannot be modified once created
Verifiable: All transactions can be verified at any point of time
Scalabale: Scales in both vertical and horizontal directions
Sharding: Sharding makes small chunks of blockchain, which is later sent for parallel processing
Parallel processing: It processess the small chunks of blockchain parallelly
Encrypted: Secured with AES and RSA Encryption, default public
Peer-to-Peer: It is decentralized and can exchange nodes or 
                transactions without involvement of central authority(Future Support)
```

### Project Dependency

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.smdi</groupId>
    <artifactId>StarBlockChain</artifactId>
    <version>v0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Implementation

- Public
```
StarBlockChain starBlockChain = new StarBlockChain();
```

- Encrypted: AES, pass encryption method, secretKey, salt(optional)
```
String secretKey = "Secret";
String saltValue = "SimpleSalt";
StarBlockChain starBlockChain = new StarBlockChain(MetaData.AES, secretKey, saltValue);
```

- Encrypted: RSA, pass encryption method
- Note: Public key is generated in public folder, It is required while encryption
- Note: Private key is generated in secrets folder, keep it in a safeplace, It is required while decryption
```
StarBlockChain starBlockChain = new StarBlockChain(MetaData.RSA);
```

- List of userNames
```
ArrayList<String> userNames = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("Adam", "Havva"));
```

- Add StarBlock #00, pass string data, userNames
```
starBlockChain.newStarBlock("Confidential data v1", userNames);
```

- Add StarBlock #01 to previous starBlock #00, pass string data, related, userNames
- Note: This starblock will be added at the end of the current row
```
starBlockChain.newStarBlock("Confidential data v2", true, userNames);
```

- Add StarBlock #10 at new row, pass string data, userNames
```
starBlockChain.newStarBlock("Transaction", userNames);
```
- Add StarBlock #11 to previous starBlock #10, pass string data, related, userNames
- Note: This starblock will be added at the end of the current row
```
starBlockChain.newStarBlock("Surcharge", true, userNames);
```

- Add StarBlock #02 to starblock #01, pass string data, related, currentIndex, index, userNames
- Note: This starblock will be added at the end of the 0th row
```
starBlockChain.newStarBlock("Confidential data v3", true, false, 0, userNames);
```

- Add StarBlock #12 to starblock #11
- Note: This starblock will be added at the end of the 1st row
```
starBlockChain.newStarBlock("Reward", true, false, 1, userNames);
```

- Check validity of starblockchain
```
boolean isValid = starBlockChain.isStarBlockChainValid();
```

- Get total nodes at index
```
System.out.println("Total newtwork strength at Index "+starBlockChain.getTotalTensorStrengthAtIndex(0));                
```
- Get total nodes of starblockchain
```
System.out.println("Total network strength "+starBlockChain.getTotalTensorNetworkStrength());
```

- Print the public starblockchain
```
System.out.println(starBlockChain.printStarBlockChain());
```

- Print the RSA encrypted starblockchain
- Note: Make sure to add private to secrets folder for decryption
```
System.out.println(starBlockChain.printStarBlockChain());
```

- Print the AES encrypted starblockchain, pass encryption method, secretKey, salt(optional)
```
System.out.println(starBlockChain.printStarBlockChain(secretKey, saltValue));
```
