# Scalable Tensor Advanced Reinforcement(STAR) BlockChain

## Hey thereðŸ‘‹, I have designed this new concept of blockchain, that can scale in both vertical and horizontal directions, It believes in grouping related nodes or transactions together

### Features

```
Open Source
Proof of Stake(POS)
Grouping: It groups similar nodes or transactions together
Permanent: All transactions are premanent
Immutable: Data cannot be modified once created
Verifiable: All transactions can be verified at any point of time
Scalabale: Scales in both vertical and horizontal directions
Sharding: Sharding makes small chunks of blockchain, which is later sent for parallel processing
Parallel processing: It processess the small chunks of blockchain parallelly
Encrypted: Secured with AES and RSA Encryption, default public
Peer-to-Peer: It is decentralized and can exchange nodes or 
                transactions without involvement of central authority(Future Support)
